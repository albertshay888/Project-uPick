### Background

This assignment was a group project required by the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. This project required that we utilize what we have learned up until that point, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. The “uPick” application was sparked by the idea that most people have all faced, a difficulty in deciding where to eat as a group. This application will help users narrow down their selections by cuisines and also by restaurants, which will also give the user details of the restaurant, such as addresses, ratings, and price range to further assist with their decision.

### Objectives
In order for us to achieve the final product of the application, we used many various technologies. On the client side, we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript along with Bootstrap, Adobe, and Principle to achieve the layout/design of the application. When users log in to use the app, the data from that game will be saved in Firebase, which is a realtime database. Google Maps API and Google Places API were used to retrieve the location of the users and generate the nearby restaurants within a 15 mile radius.
